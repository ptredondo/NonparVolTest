Description: This package provides functions to perform the following: (i) generate observations from the multiple time series with clustered volatility (ARCH-type), (ii) estimate the parameters of the multiple time series with clustered volatility (ARCH-type) model through the backfitting algorithm, and (iii) compute the bootstrap confidence interval for the slope parameters of the clustered volatility (ARCH-type) model.
